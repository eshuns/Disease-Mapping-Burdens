# County Burden Indices (Cervical Cancer + HIV + SVI)

This repository generates reproducible, county-level composite burden indices:
- **Cervical Cancer Burden Index** (incidence + mortality + screening + SVI)
- **HIV Burden Index** (HIV incidence rate + SVI)

Outputs include choropleth maps for individual components and a composite map with highlighted high-burden counties.
